SCFit takes an idealized list of openings and closings from single channel recordings and fits rates in a single channel gating mechanism using an exact correction for missed events. The application is based largely on the work of Hawkes, Jalali, and Colquhoun (1990), Hawkes and Jalali (1992), and Hawkes, Jalali, and Colquhoun (1992).

SCFit is primarily a collection of Matlab functions and scripts that will load the idealized data from an SCN file generated by the [SCAN](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dcpr95.html#scan) idealization program or by QuB.

## Standalone App

In addition to the Matlab functions, there is a standalone GUI application, which packages all the data preprocessing and model loading steps.
