SCFit takes an idealized list of openings and closings from single channel recordings and fits rates in a single channel gating mechanism using an exact correction for missed events. The application is based largely on the work of Hawkes, Jalali, and Colquhoun (1990), Hawkes and Jalali (1992), and Hawkes, Jalali, and Colquhoun (1992).

## Standalone App

A standalone GUI application can be [downloaded]({{ page.appurl }}) and installed.

Unzip the zip file and run {{ page.appexe }}, which will install the Matlab runtime and the app.
