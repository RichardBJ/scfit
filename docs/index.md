SCFit takes an idealized list of openings and closings from single channel
recordings and fits rates in a single channel gating mechanism using an exact
correction for missed events. The application is based largely on the work of
Hawkes, Jalali, and Colquhoun (1990), Hawkes and Jalali (1992), and Hawkes,
Jalali, and Colquhoun (1992).

SCFit is primarily a collection of Matlab functions and scripts that do the following:
1. Load idealized data from an SCN file generated by the [SCAN](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dcpr95.html#scan) idealization
program or by QuB
1. Pre-process the data
    - impose a resolution
    - concatenate contiguous openings
    - find a critical shut time to split the data into bursts of openings
1. Load a channel gating model
    - fix rates to obey microscopic reversibility
1. Fit the rates in the gating mechanism using the maximum likelihood method
    - an exact correction for missed events due to the resolution is used to calculate the likelihood

## Standalone App

In addition to the Matlab functions, there is a standalone GUI application, which packages all the data preprocessing and model loading steps.
